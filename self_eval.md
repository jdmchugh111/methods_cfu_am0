# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? Being able to solve the food coding problem - I thought I had everything right at first but it wasn't returning the right output. Through trial and error I realized that I need to write "end" at the end of my conditional AND at the end of defining the method
- What is the power of using methods in our applications? whether it's built-in methods or user-defined methods, they can be very useful for performing simple or complex functions on variables/arguments
